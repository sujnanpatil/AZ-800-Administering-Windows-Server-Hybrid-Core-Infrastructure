## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server

In this exercise, you will provision Azure VMs running Windows Server using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. This will involve creating a resource group and deploying the VM using predefined ARM templates. You will also configure the virtual network to support Azure VMs.

### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group by using an Azure Resource Manager template

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group using an ARM template. This resource group will be used to organize the resources provisioned in this lab, ensuring a structured approach to managing resources within Azure.

1. Connect to **SEA-ADM1**, and if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, start Microsoft Edge, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by using the following credentials : 

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell pane by selecting the toolbar icon directly next to the search text box.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

   >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting Cloud Shell and you are presented with the **Getting started** page, select the subscription you are using in this lab, then select **No storage account required**, and **Apply**.

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Manage Files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload**, and then upload the **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-sub_template.json** file to the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following commands to create a resource group that will contain the resources you provision in this lab. (Replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of an Azure region into which you can deploy Azure virtual machines, such as **eastus**.)

   >**Note**: This lab has been tested and verified using East US, so you should use that region. In general, to identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [Find Azure credit offers in your region](https://aka.ms/regions-offers).

   ```powershell
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   $rgName = 'AZ800-L0401-RG'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az800l04subDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-sub_template.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName $rgName
   ```

### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

In this task, you will deploy an Azure VM using an ARM template. This Azure VM will be running Windows Server and will be used for managing the system in later exercises.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, upload an Azure Resource Manager template **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-rg_template.json** and the corresponding Azure Resource Manager parameter file **C:\Labfiles\AZ-800-Administering-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Core-Infrastructure-master\Allfiles\Labfiles\Lab04\L04-rg_template.parameters.json**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to deploy an Azure VM running Windows Server that you'll be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name az800l04rgDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/L04-rg_template.parameters.json
   ```

   >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take about 5 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, close the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box in the toolbar, search for and select the virtual network, and then on the **Virtual network** page select **az800l04-vnet**.

1. On the **az800l04-vnet** page, under **Settings** section, select **Subnets**, and then, on the **Subnets** page, select **+ subnet**.
