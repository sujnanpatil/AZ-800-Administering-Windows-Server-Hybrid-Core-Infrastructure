# Lab 10: Implementing Azure File Sync

## Lab scenario

To address concerns regarding Distributed File System (DFS) Replication between Contoso's London headquarters and its Seattle–based branch office, you decide to test Azure File Sync as an alternative replication mechanism between two on-premises file shares.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-800%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Implementing%20Azure%20File%20Sync)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Exercise 1: Implementing Distributed File System (DFS) Replication in your on-premises environment
- Exercise 2: Creating and configuring a sync group
- Exercise 3: Replacing DFS Replication with File Sync-based replication
- Exercise 4: Verifying replication and enabling cloud tiering
- Exercise 5: Troubleshooting replication issues

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

   ![](./media/SS2.png)

## Exercise 4: Verifying replication and enabling cloud tiering

### Task 1: Verify File Sync

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the File Explorer window displaying the content of the **\\\\SEA-SVR1\\Data** share. 

1. Create another arbitrarily named file in the **\\\\SEA-SVR1\\Data** folder.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the File Explorer window displaying the content of the **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Data** share and verify that, shortly afterwards, the file with the same name also appears in the **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Data** folder.

   >**Note** You removed DFS Replication in the previous exercise, which means that File Sync replicated the newly created file.

### Task 2: Enable cloud tiering

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, in the Azure portal, on the **Sync1** sync group page, select **SEA-SVR2.Contoso.com** in the **server endpoints** section.

1. In the Server Endpoint Properties pane, Under **settings** section, select **Cloud Tiering Settings**. 

1. Select **Enable cloud Tiering** In the **Always preserve the specified percentage of free space on the volume** text box, enter **90** and select **Enabled Date policy**. In the **Only cache files that were accessed or modified within the specified number of days** text box, enter **14**, and then select **Save**.  

   >**Note:** After some time, files on **SEA-SVR2** would be automatically tiered. You will trigger this process by using PowerShell.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window:

1. In the **Windows PowerShell ISE**, in the console pane, trigger tiering immediately by entering the following commands and pressing Enter after each:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -computername SEA-SVR2
   fsutil file createnew S:\Data\report1.docx 254321098
   fsutil file createnew S:\Data\report2.docx 254321098
   fsutil file createnew S:\Data\report3.docx 254321098
   fsutil file createnew S:\Data\report4.docx 254321098
   Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
   Invoke-StorageSyncCloudTiering -Path S:\Data 
   ```
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the File Explorer window displaying the content of the **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Data** folder.

      ![](./media/2.png)

1. In the File Explorer window, add the **Attributes** column in the details pane by right-clicking or accessing the context menu for the **Title** column in the details pane; for example, in the **Name** column, select **More**, select the **Attributes** checkbox, and then select **OK**.

      ![](./media/dataimg.png)

1. Drag the **Attributes** column to be next to the **Name** column, and then note the file dates and their attributes.

1. Identify files with the attribute **L**, **M**, and **O**, which indicate that the tiering took place. 

## Exercise 5: Troubleshooting replication issues

### Task 1: Monitor File Sync replication

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, use File Explorer to copy the **C:\\Windows\\INF** folder to **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Data\\**. The folder will sync to the cloud endpoint, which will cause sync traffic.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, switch to the Azure portal displaying the **Sync1** sync group page of the **FileSync1** Storage Sync Service.

1. In the **server endpoints** section, verify that the **Health** of both endpoints has green check marks.

1. Select the **SEA-SVR2.Contoso.com** endpoint in the Server Endpoint Properties pane, review **Sync Activity**, and then close the pane.

1. Select the **Files Synced** graph, and then explore how you can customize the graph by using a filter.

1. Switch to the File Explorer window displaying the content of drive **Z** mapped to the Azure File share and verify that the drive contains the content of the **INF** folder synchronized from **\\\\SEA-SVR2\\Data**.

1. Switch to the Azure portal displaying **Sync1** under **Monitoring** section, select status and verify that the **INF** sync traffic is reflected in the **Files Synced** and **Bytes Synced** graphs. The **INF** folder has more than 800 files, and its size is more than 40 MB.

    ![](./media/E5T1.png)

   >**Note:** You might need to refresh the page displaying the Azure portal to see the updated statistics.

### Task 2: Test replication conflict resolution

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, position the File Explorer windows displaying the content of **\\\\SEA-SVR1\Data\\** and **\\\\SEA-SVR2\Data\\** side-by-side.

1. In the File Explorer window displaying the content of **\\\\SEA-SVR2\Data\\**, create a file named **Demo.txt**. 

1. In the File Explorer window displaying the content of **\\\\SEA-SVR1\Data\\**, create a file named **Demo.txt**. 

1. Add an arbitrary text to the first **Demo.txt** file and save the change.

1. Immediately afterwards, add an arbitrary text (different from the one you used in the previous step) to the second **Demo.txt** file and save the change.

   >**Note:** Make sure to save the change to the second file as soon as possible. You're creating files with the same name but different content to intentionally trigger a sync conflict.

1. In each File Explorer window, review their content and verify what they contain, in addition to the **Demo.txt** file, also check for **Demo-SEA-SVR2.txt** (and potentially **Demo-Cloud.txt**). 

   >**Note:** This is because File Sync detected a sync conflict and added a suffix representing the endpoint name (**SEA-SVR2**) or **Cloud** to the file that caused the conflict.

   >**Note:** You might need to wait a few minutes for the sync conflict to occur.
