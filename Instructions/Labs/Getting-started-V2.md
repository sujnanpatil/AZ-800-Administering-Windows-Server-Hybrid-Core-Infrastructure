3. If you have not extended the duration prior to when the lab is about to end, a pop-up will appear, giving you the option to extend. Click  **OK** to proceed. 

## Workaround for Copying PowerShell Commands

If you encounter any difficulties with copy-pasting PowerShell commands directly, you can use the following workaround:

1. Open a text editor such as Notepad on your local machine.

2. Copy the PowerShell commands from the lab guide and paste them into the text editor.

3. Ensure that the formatting of the commands remains intact.

4. Copy the commands from the text editor and paste them into your virtual machine's terminal or PowerShell window.

By following this workaround, you can ensure accurate execution of the PowerShell commands in your lab environment.
